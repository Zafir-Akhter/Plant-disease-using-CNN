#🌿 Plant Disease Detection with CNN
A deep learning project for identifying plant diseases from leaf images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This tool helps automate early diagnosis, supporting farmers and agricultural experts with accurate, image-based predictions.

🚀 Key Features
CNN-based image classification for multiple plant diseases

Trained on the PlantVillage dataset (or custom datasets)

Image preprocessing and augmentation pipeline

Easy training and inference scripts

Evaluation metrics and visualizations included

🛠️ Built With
Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch

OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib

📦 Quick Start
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/plant-disease-cnn.git  
cd plant-disease-cnn  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
python train.py  # To train the model  
python predict.py --image path_to_image.jpg  # To make predictions
📈 Accuracy
Achieves high accuracy on validation data with strong generalization on unseen leaf samples.

📌 TODO
Add mobile/web app interface

Integrate transfer learning for improved performance

Real-time detection via camera feed
